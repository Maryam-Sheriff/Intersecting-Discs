# Intersecting-Discs
<h2> Project 1: Intersecting Discs (two solutions minimum)</h2>
<h4>
<br>
We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N - 1. A zero-indexed array A of
N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. The J-th disc is drawn
with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J]. We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K
and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their
borders)</h4>

<h4>
Sample Input:
<br>
The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:
<br>
A[0] = 1
<br>
A[1] = 5
<br>
A[2] = 2
<br>
A[3] = 1
<br>
A[4] = 4
<br>
A[5] = 0
<br>
Sample Output:
<br>
There are eleven (11) (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:
<br>
 discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
<br>
 disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
